So you made it this far huh? Great! well the final task is really an easy one.
I have uploaded the solution in the task2.py file here.
I wanted to end it on an a relaxing one. All you have to do is put all the code you have written till now and put most of it in 
a while loop continuosly till the user is fed up of playing the game or the user just decides to quit.
I have already uploaded the solution file in the final.py file here since its not much of a challenge.

next up is your decision because there is so much you can do with project one of which is adding a gui to the game.
GUI(graphical user interface) is just fancy way of saying making a screen with butoons and stuff so that user doesn't have to
stare at a boring terminal window.
The reason I didn't include the GUI portion was beacuse this is just a beginner level project and The GUI would
include functions,classes and objects and all that stuff.
If you are interested in making a gui you can either make one yourself or if you think you can't do it on your own just reach
out to me at vandanrohatgi@gmail.com or the helloworld group on whatsapp and we can extend this project.
